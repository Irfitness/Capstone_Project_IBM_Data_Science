With a population of 675,000 in the city and 2,500,000 in the metropolitan area, it is the largest city in British Columbia and the thrid largest metropolitan area in Canada.  \n\nWhile dense metropolitan areas bring opportunities, they also create constraints. These constraints can lead to stiff competition and high rents for prime business locations. Because of this, choosing the right location for a new business can make the difference between success and failure.  \n\nWhle there is no substitute for local knowledge and understanding of a city and its neighborhoods, this projects sets out to take advantage of powerful data science tools and techniques in order to gain new insights into the city of Vancouver. These insights will facilitate determining the best location to open a new business."
